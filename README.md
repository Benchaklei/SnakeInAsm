# SnakeAsm
## A snake game written in assembly (x86_16 nasm)
I wrote this project in 8086 16 bit assembly language using nasm assembler.

## How to run it?
Assemble the program using nasm:
**`nasm main.asm -o snake.com`**

Then just run **`snake.com`** in DOSBOX 

## Gameplay keys
* Use the arrow keys to move up/down/left/right
* ESC quits the game
* SPACE pauses the game
